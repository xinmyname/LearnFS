// First implement a foldl function, with the signature (a->b->a) -> a -> [b] -> a
// Now use your foldl function to implement a map function, with the signature (a->b) -> [a] -> [b]
// Finally use your map function to convert an array of strings to upper case
//
// Test cases are in TestFoldMapUCase.cs
//
// Note: F# provides standard implementations of the fold and map operations, but the 
// exercise here is to build them up from primitive elements...
